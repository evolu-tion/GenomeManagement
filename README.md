# Usage: Promoter of genes retrieving
Then run python script by used command line on windows or unix::

    python3 promoter_retrieve.py \
		--output <output_file.fa> \
		--output_format <fasta/gff> \
		--genome <genome.fa> \
		--gff <genome.gff> \
		--type <TLS/TSS> \
		--upstream <bp> \
		--downstream <bp> \
		--all_gene <Y/N> \
		--selected_gene_list <gene_list.txt, is optional if all_gene is N> \
		--remove_n_gap <Y/N> \
		--min_length <default is 100 bp>

# Usage: Get protein or gene sequences from genome
	python3 proteins_retrieve.py \
		--input <input_fasta_file> \
		--list_of_interest <list_of_protein_id.txt> \
		--output <output_file.fa>

# Usage: Get genome statistic
	python3 get_genome_statistic.py \
		--genome <genome.fa>
