# Welcome to GenomeManagement

**GenomeManagement** is a comprehensive Python package designed for genome sequence analysis, promoter retrieval, and statistical analysis of genomic data. It provides a suite of command-line tools and a flexible Python API for bioinformatics workflows.

## Features

- **Promoter Retrieval**: Extract promoter sequences from TSS (Transcription Start Site) or TLS (Translation Start Site).
- **Protein Analysis**: Retrieve protein sequences based on custom lists.
- **Genome Statistics**: Calculate N50, L50, GC content, and other genomic metrics.
- **PlantPAN Integration**: Automate promoter analysis using PlantPAN 2.0 and 3.0.
- **MEME Integration**: Convert MEME XML output to BED format.
- **Flexible API**: Powerful `FastaManager` and `GffManager` classes for custom scripts.
